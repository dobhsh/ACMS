# ACMS - Store Feedback Collection & Rating System

Description

Amazon customers can opt-in their nearby store shop [powered by Amazon] as delivery address. The customer packages would be delivered to their chosen store shop and later the customer would pick their packages from the store whenever convenient.

Since store owners play a critical role in package management at their store and customers have to interact with the store owner to pickup their packages, we want to collect the store feedback from customers once they are done with their package pickup.

Apart from customers feedback, we also want to evaluate the store performance based on their package management traits [successful delivery, delivery failures, successful pickup, pickup failures, package lost].

Based on their performance, we also want to send accolades/rewards to the store owners. These are the following constraints which should meet simultaneously to review the performance as successful:-

1. Avg. customer feedback rating should be >= 4 for at least 1000 responses in total.
2. Successful delivery >= 98% & delivery failures <= 1% & successful pickup >= 98% & package lost <= 1%
